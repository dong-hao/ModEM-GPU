SIGNconvention:  integer variable "sign" in model_data module
is the sign convention, in the sense that a time dependence
of exp(sign*omega*t) is assumed.  WS assumed sign = -1;
This is the opposite of my standard data processing assumption,
which is consistent with the convention usually assumed in the FFT.
