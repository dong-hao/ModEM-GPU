Hi,

I copied Van on this reply.

There is no published timetable for feature implementation.

The best you can do is to make sure that your vendor
knows what your priorities are.  Right now, vendors
seem to be either trying to finish all of Fortran 2003,
or are jumping to coarrays next.

Intel seems to be working hard to get the new features
into their compiler.  I don't know about PGI.

HTH

PS You can download a copy of the draft of the f08 standard
from j3's web site.  (Google 007.pdf)

This is not exactly what I had in mind, but in some ways this is a cleaner solution; this certainly solves more than one problem of Fortran in relation to large programs. Eagerly looking forward to submodules being implemented by the compilers. Once they are implemented, I am certain they would be extensively used, at least by us. In fact, I think we are going to plan accordingly and rethink our module dependencies.
