| This file defines model covariance for a recursive autoregression scheme.   |
| The model space may be divided into distinct areas using integer masks.     |
| Mask 0 is reserved for air; mask 9 is reserved for ocean. Smoothing between |
| air, ocean and the rest of the model is turned off automatically. You can   |
| also define exceptions to override smoothing between any two model areas.   |
| To turn off smoothing set it to zero. This header is 16 lines long.         |
| 1. Grid dimensions excluding air layers (Nx, Ny, NzEarth)                   |
| 2. Smoothing in the X direction (NzEarth real values)                       |
| 3. Smoothing in the Y direction (NzEarth real values)                       |
| 4. Vertical smoothing (1 real value)                                        |
| 5. Number of times the smoothing should be applied (1 integer >= 0)         |
| 6. Number of exceptions (1 integer >= 0)                                    |
| 7. Exceptions in the form e.g. 2 3 0. (to turn off smoothing between 2 & 3) |
| 8. Two integer layer indices and Nx x Ny block of masks, repeated as needed.|
