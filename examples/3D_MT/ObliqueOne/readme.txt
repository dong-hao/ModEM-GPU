Test Model "Oblique One" by Kristina Tietze
===========================================

FWD:
FWD data were obtained using a background model providing the solution of the electric fields at the model edges (boundaries).
In order to reproduce data, calculate background solution first, and then use eSoln to compute FWD responses of ObliqueOne (as given in my_script).

===========================================
===========================================
INV: 
5% Noise was added to Impedances. 
===========================================
Z_10_5_16p_100st_ObliqueOne_Noise50.data:
----------------------
Full_Impedance, 10 and 5% errors for on-/off-diagonal elements [abs(Zxy*Zyx)^0.5]

===========================================
ZOffD_5e1_16p_100st_ObliqueOne_Noise50.data:
----------------------
Off_Diagonal_Impedance, 5% errors [abs(Zij)]

===========================================
logrp_R10deg1_16p_100st_ObliqueOne_Noise50.data:
----------------------
log(rho) & phases (off-diagonal)
errors: 1 degree for phases, 10% of (linear) rho for rho.
